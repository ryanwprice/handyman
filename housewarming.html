        <h1>Handyman Housewarming</h1>
        <section id="intro">
            <h2>Give your clients a gift that will help make their new house a home! </h2>
            <p>Every new home purchase comes with a to-do list a mile long!</p>
            <p>Fixing drywall holes from old pictures, shelving, tv mounts, etc., loose handrails, squeaky doors, wonky cupboards, and the list goes on. These are just some of the tasks that new homeowners need to tackle before they can truly settle in to their new home.</p>
            <p>Imagine if you could take care of that honey-do list for your clients!</p>
        </section>
        <section id="offer">
            <h2>What I do!</h2>
            <p>I will come in for a full 8 hour day to work through the list of items on your clients' new home to do list.</p>
            <p>Eight hours is a lot of time to work through a list of small tasks, but not every item is guaranteed to be completed. I work quickly and efficiently, and will go in order of the prioritized list from the homeowner. Incomplete work will be priced out and an estimate can be given to the selling agent or the homeowner.</p>
            <p>Basic materials (caulking, screws, drywall compound, etc.) are included in the price. Higher cost items, like paint, are added at cost to the bill.</p>
            <p>It isn't required, but I do recommend scheduling time before the work is done to meet at the new house and go over the list so I know exactly what needs to be done so I can maximize the time available in the day.</p>
        
            <h2>What I don't do!</h2>
            <p>I am not an electrician or plumber so I can not legally replace broken outlets, install new lighting, or repair broken plumbing. I can however stop a running toilet, replace a faucet, or missing outlet cover.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="extras">
            <h2>Extras</h2>
            <p>Not every material is included in the base fee. Some common items that will add to the cost include:</p>
            <h3>Welcome bouqet</h3>
            <p>A beautiful bouqet of locally grown flowers can be left for the homeowner on the kitchen counter to add that finishing touch to the day. Flowers are provided by <a class="link" href="https://www.instagram.com/florencemeettom/">Florence meet Tom Blooms</a> and are available seasonally at market price.</p>
            <h3>New locksets</h3>
            <p>I can install new locksets on each exterior door. New hardware for any door or cabinet can be tackled.</p>
            <p>Specific locksets can be selected by the homeowner to ensure they get the colour, style, and functionality they are looking for. Locksets are purchased at cost and added to the final bill.</p>
            
            <h3>Painting</h3>
            <p>A room, depending on size, can take up most of a day (or more), however, while the paint dries, I can be working on other tasks.</p>
            <p>Paint must be selected prior to work and a specific colour number provided for Sherwin-Williams, CIL Dulux, or Benjamin Moore. Colour matching is not available as an option because there is no guarantee it will truly &ldquo;match&rdquo;</p>
            
            <h3>Fixtures</h3>
            <p>Curtain rods, floating shelves, TV mounts, etc. can all be installed where the homeowner wants them, but the objects themselves are to be provided by the homeowner unless otherwise agreed upon.</p>
